My name is Charles Wall-Davis. I’m from Virginia and I’m a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I’m involved with the Cornell NSBE Chapter (National Society of Black Engineers) and MOCA (Men of Color in Athletics) as well as part of the Cornell Track and Field Team as a hurdler. I would consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to what interests me. I'm an avid enjoyer of running, video game music, board games, anime, and graphic novels. I’m still exploring what I want to do career wise as mechanical engineering is a vast field but I have some interest in robotics, biomechanics, and product design.  

I’ve been running track since I was around 9 and have been through the many ups and downs of being a student-athlete. The teamwork, discipline, and self motivation are strengths I continue to carry with me throughout life. Managing time as a student athlete is also difficult but manageable and I always leave time to hang out with friends every once in a while for games or just chatting about anything. 

I’ve previously interned at Dominion Energy as an engineering intern last summer. I worked with the Regional Operation Center and got to learn a lot about transmission line switching, grid planning, and nuclear work. The workplace helped me learn the value of safety and communication when it comes to working with multiple groups on a single project. It was an amazing opportunity to see and work with the mechanical applications of energy as well as exploring the electrical applications.
